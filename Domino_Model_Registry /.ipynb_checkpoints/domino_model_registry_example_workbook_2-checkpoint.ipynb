    "# MLflow Experiment Best Run Model Registration\n",
    "\n",
    "This `domino_model_registry_example_workbook_2.ipynb` Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to find the best model run within an experiment, based on a specified performance metric, and register that model using MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "* Explore all runs within a specific MLflow experiment.\n",
    "* Find the best-performing model based on a user-defined metric (default: accuracy).\n",
    "* Register the best model in the MLflow Model Registry for later use and tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Covered:\n",
    "1. Set up and configure MLflow to retrieve experiment data.\n",
    "2. Use the `MlflowClient` to search for runs based on a specific performance metric.\n",
    "3. Automatically register the model from the best run in the MLflow Model Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "* A pre-existing MLflow experiment with multiple runs.\n",
    "* Logged metrics and models from these runs (e.g., `overall_accuracy`, `f1-score`, etc.).\n",
    "* Access to the MLflow Tracking server and Model Registry.\n",
